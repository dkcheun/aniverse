# Aniverse
[ Join the Discord ](discord.gg/WhaGEYES5p)  

An unplanned, caffeine-fueled, ambitious rewrite of my initial uneducated attempt at recreating a psuedo-Anify / Consumet API in Go. What should have been a simple project spiraled into a hot mess.

## What You'll Probably Never Use (Features)

- **Search Anime**: Yes, you can search for anime by title. Not much to explain here, right?
- **Anime Information**: Get all the data you never knew you needed about your favorite shows from **AniList**.
- **Stream Episodes**: Why go elsewhere? Fetch streaming links straight from **GogoAnime** and start watching right away.
- **Dub or Sub**: Aniverse is inclusive! Find both dubbed and subbed versions, and we're proud of it. 
- **Data Merging**: We merge stuff. Like subbed episodes, dubbed episodes, sources—everything! It’s like a messy combination of your anime metadata, but it works (most of the time).
- **Caching** (Soon): We cache. Not for fun, but to save your server from collapsing.

## Can I Run It? (Requirements)
Yes, but only if you have:
- Go 1.18+ installed (or anything more recent, depending on when you're reading this).
- Redis (because we love caching).
- A lot of patience (trust me, you’ll need it).

## Bugs, Glitches, and Crashes  

There will be bugs. Expect things to break in ways you never thought possible. If that happens, open an issue on GitHub, and we’ll get to it eventually.
